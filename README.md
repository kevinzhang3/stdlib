# Custom C++ stdlib

This project provides some of the commonly used data structures and utilities in the C++ STL. The main goal was to advance my C++ skills while brushing up on DSA and idiomatic programming.

The library uses an exceptionless design, so it can be used with `-fno-exceptions`, for example.
